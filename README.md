# Plane-Frame-Analysis

Program implements the A. Kassimali Direct Stiffness Method to analyze plane frame trusses. The driver is named Structural_2_Project. Truss data is read in through an excel file named 'trussdata.xlsx'. Users should input into spreadsheet the desired truss's joint data, support data, material property, cross-sectional area property, member data, joint loads, and member loads. The program uses a collection of functions to perform analysis and store data. Program outputs joint displacements, axial forces in truss members, and reaction forces in the truss supports.
